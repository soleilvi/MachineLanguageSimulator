# Working Process and Result
The program converts the hexadecimal numbers from the input file into unsigned 64-bit decimal numbers. If the command in the file was "ADD," it adds the two hexadecimals in the same line. If their result is valid, it prints it out in decimal form. If there is an overflow, it states that it is an overflow.
